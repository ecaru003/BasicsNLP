Module Six - Basic Natural Language Processing

This repository is the result of a brief overview of Natural Language Processing as a result of an interesting module in my COP 4813 course. 
In short, it downloads a json of data from the New York Times API, processes and filters the text within (removes stop words, punctuation),
and then reports the ten most common words within the provided list. Amusingly enough, it even generates a word cloud of those common words.

These fundementals are employed in COP4813_Project1, where using the streamlist framework, a site is created.
